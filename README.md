# Ecoacoustics analysis tools

This repository is dedicated to share some codes (mostly in R) for analysis ecoacoustics data.

*Full disclosure:* this is written by an ecologist that can do R. I don't have any compute science/programming formal education so I apologise in advance if the code is not the prettiest. I do try to learn best practices and applly them but this is not a blog for programmers :)

Hope this is useful
